    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for pan
      </li>
      <li>
        2 slices applewood-smoked bacon
      </li>
      <li>
        4 canned pineapple rings
      </li>
      <li>
        1 pound fresh pizza dough, at room temperature
      </li>
      <li>
        ½ cup pizza sauce
      </li>
      <li>
        2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
      </li>
      <li>
        ¼ cup thinly sliced red onion
      </li>
      <li>
        4 slices Canadian bacon, cut into 1-inch triangles
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
        Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) with a rack in the lower 
        position. Oil a large rimmed baking sheet with olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2</strong>
        Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add bacon and cook, flipping 
        occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper 
        towel-lined plate.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3</strong>
        Pour out pan drippings without wiping pan clean, and return skillet to heat. Add 
        pineapple, cook until lightly browned and caramelized, 3 minutes per side. 
        Remove from pan. Chop bacon and cut pineapple rings into 3/4-inch pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4</strong>
        On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to a 12-inch circle and place on the oiled 
        baking sheet. Prick dough with a fork several times to reduce air bubbles. 
        Spread pizza sauce evenly over dough, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border around 
        edges. Sprinkle with cheese, red onion, Canadian bacon, chopped pineapple, 
        and chopped bacon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 5</strong>
        Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, toppings are lightly charred, 
        and crust is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
